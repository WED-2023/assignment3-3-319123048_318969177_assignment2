## Project Overview

This Vue.js application serves as the client side for our recipes platform.  
It interacts with a Node.js + Express backend using RESTful APIs to manage users, recipes, search history, favorites, and more.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- User authentication (register, login, logout)
- View recipe details from both local DB and Spoonacular API
- Search for recipes with filters: cuisine, diet, intolerances
- Sorting options (popularity, preparation time)
- Like & favorite recipes (local and API-based)
- Track and display viewed recipes and search history
- Create custom recipes and family recipes
- Responsive design using BootstrapVue
- Session-based login with cookie handling

## ðŸ”— Backend Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend (Node.js server) via `axios` HTTP requests.  
The backend exposes endpoints under 2 options:
- local: `http://localhost:3000/api`
- remote: `noa-yaki.cs.bgu.ac.il`

The server handles:

- Authentication via session cookies
- Recipe data from both MySQL and Spoonacular
- Logging of views, likes, and search history

Make sure the backend server is running before starting the frontend.
If using the remote server through the Contorl Remote, you can enter the web using the DNS address - `noa-yaki.cs.bgu.ac.il`
